## Artifacts for the paper, "Estimating Residual Risk in Greybox Fuzzing".

We kindly request ESEC/FSE'21 artifact evaluation committee to consider our artifact as,
  - available, functional, and reusable.

We make available,
  - all the ***scripts*** and ***data*** to reproduce the results appear in the paper.
  - the pre-validated ***instructions*** to reproduce the results by running the Jupyter workbooks locally. 
    (The instructions include machine, environment, and library requirements)
  - instructions to replace the experimental data files for any other greybox fuzzing campaign and generate same set of outputs for new data.
