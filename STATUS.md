We are appling for the functional, reusable, and artifacts available badges.

We make available,
  - all the ***scripts*** and ***data*** to reproduce the results appear in our paper "Estimating Residual Risk in Greybox Fuzzing".
  - the pre-validated ***instructions*** to reproduce the results by running the Jupyter workbooks locally. 
    (The instructions include machine, environment, and library requirements)
  - instructions to replace the experimental data files for any other greybox fuzzing campaign and generate same set of outputs for new data.
